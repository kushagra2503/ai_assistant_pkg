# Excel Visualization Fixes

## Issues Fixed
This update fixes two critical errors in the Excel visualization functionality:

1. **String vs Integer Comparison Error**
   ```
   Error generating Excel visualization: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
   ```
   This error occurred when trying to compare or sort string values (like month names) with numeric values during the pie chart generation process.

2. **Index Out of Bounds Error**
   ```
   Error generating Excel visualization: index 0 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0
   ```
   This error occurred when generating charts with data that became empty after preprocessing (e.g., when all values converted to NaN).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Excel Visualization Handler

In `ai_assistant/utils/excel_handler.py`:
- Modified the `generate_excel_visualization` method to handle mixed data types properly
- Added proper type conversion for x-axis values (converting to string) to avoid comparison issues
- Improved error handling and added better column existence checks
- Changed the pie chart generation to use groupby before plotting
- Added data cleaning step for numeric values using pd.to_numeric with errors='coerce'
- **NEW**: Added checks for empty DataFrames after preprocessing
- **NEW**: Added special handling for bar charts with grouped data
- **NEW**: Added proper sorting for line charts with date columns
- **NEW**: Added validation for pie charts after grouping operations

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in UI

In `ai_assistant/core/app.py`:
- Added improved error handling with specific error messages
- Added helpful suggestions when errors occur
- Provided column name suggestions when column not found errors occur
- Added more context to visualization error messages

### 3. Improved NLP Processing

In `ai_assistant/utils/excel_nlp.py`:
- Enhanced regex patterns to better handle column names with spaces
- Improved extraction of column names from natural language commands
- Added better trimming of extracted column names

## Testing

To verify the fixes work, run the provided test scripts:

```bash
# Test the string vs int comparison fix
python test_excel_viz.py

# Test the empty dataset handling fix
python test_empty_dataset.py
```

These test scripts check:
1. Pie chart generation with string months and numeric profit values
2. Handling of mixed data types in category columns
3. Proper handling of date columns
4. Handling of datasets that become empty after preprocessing
5. Handling of single data point visualization
6. Error handling for invalid data types

## Example Usage

The fixes allow users to create visualizations with various data types without errors:

```
/excel create pie chart from sales.xlsx with x as Month and y as Profit
/excel create bar chart from data.xlsx with x as Category and y as Value
```

When errors do occur, the user will now receive helpful suggestions rather than cryptic error messages.

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with all existing Excel functionality
- Performance should be unchanged or slightly better due to improved error handling
- The changes allow for more flexible usage of column types in visualizations
- Added special handling for edge cases like empty datasets and single data points
